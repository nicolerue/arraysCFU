## How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- On a scale of 1-5, I'd say.. 3.8ish. I feel like there's so many things to know about arrays, and all the methods that can be applied to them, but so far the concept of adding methods and understanding the zero indexing makes sense. 
## Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- I was running into some interesting outcomes with the slice method where the original array was outputing in the console even when I had sliced it. Which made me wonder about why that is... will need to do more experimenting. 
# What questions do you have about Arrays?
- Are the original arrays permanently changed after methods have been applied to them? I think this relates to my wonderings in the above question.
